##### Description:
This project was an idea my wife came up with as she aspires to be a crafting and Recipe Content Creator and came up with this idea as she was scrolling thru hundreds of recipe and crafting sites. Her and her friends hate having to comb thru stories just to get to the good stuff such as recipe’s and instructions on how to make certain things either crafting or in the kitchen. So she wants to start a new trend. The recipe and the steps first then a story about the product or video.

##### Use Case
The main use for this website would be for those who want to learn how to make something craftwise or in the kitchen. What my wife says is that it will bring a midwestern charm to life in the City. the Simplistic of it all. Problems that i might face are creating a dynamic form so that she can add bigger recipe’s that need lots of ingredients or steps to make a crafting idea. Also being able to upload pics and video to a page. (Who are the main users? What problems are they facing that you will solve? What will it do for users? What is the purpose/goal of the project?)

##### Minimum Viable Product
(List the absolute minimum features the project requires before it is considered in a pre-alpha state)
Minimum viable product would be the splash page and ability to add crafting procedure and lists of items in it, or ingredients and cooking steps.##### Tools for MVP
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your MVP. Be specific.)
 *React and JavaScript most likely. I might make it out of C# MVC but i think this is better suited for React and JavaScript.



##### Additional Features
(If you finish developing your MVP and have time to spare, what features do you want to work on next? Be specific.)
Additional features would be to create a supporters section where registered users could go and get more in-depth knowledge on a project or recipe.
 Pictures for each including the ability to upload a picture or video of the steps. And it be added to the right recipe or crafting area.

Ability to 
##### Tools for Additional Features
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your additional features. Be specific.)
 * might need a mySql database for photos and video urls to link them to recipe or crafting projects.

##### Additional Information

This project is based off the wants my wife wants for her website. She wants me to create a site her and her friends have been wanting to visit for sometime now. She is getting into the content creating market so we came up with the plan to include that idea with her content creation so she can market herself as well as for people to get recipes and crafting steps with out having to read stories first.







reasearch for Capstone.
Sat Down with Sara Schaaf. Talked to her about what she wanted for her site. made a site diagram

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
